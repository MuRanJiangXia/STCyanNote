  <center><h1>Smartisan Service Terms</h1></center>
</head>
<body>

<p>Special Note: </p>
<p>Thank you for applying to use the services provided by Smartisan Technology Ltd. and its affiliates (or simply “Smartisan” after this). Before you (hereafter called “the User”) use any of the services provided by Smartisan, you must read and fully understand this agreement (“the Agreement”) and its contents, especially those parts in bold, including, but not limited to, the terms regarding exemption or limitation of liability. If you do not agree to the Agreement and/or any of its changes, you can stop using the services provided by Smartisan. Using the services will be taken to mean that you have understood and completely agree to the terms of the Agreement, including any changes that Smartisan may make to it, and that in so doing you become a Smartisan user.</p>


<p><b>1.&nbsp;General Terms</b></p>


<ol class="latin">
  <li>The User should agree to the Agreement’s terms and complete the registration according to the notice given here. By clicking the “Agree” button the User enters into an agreement with Smartisan and completely accepts the terms of the Agreement.</li>
  <li>After completing the registration, Smartisan will grant each User an account (called a “Smartisan ID”) and a corresponding password. The safekeeping of this account and password are the User’s responsibility. The User holds legal responsibility for all activity and events carried out with their account.</li>
  <li>Unless otherwise expressly stated, all new Smartisan products, features, and services are covered under the Agreement.</li>
  <li>When the User is using Smartisan’s services, they should agree, in a manner approved by Smartisan, to each individual service’s terms or agreement and to any announcements Smartisan may release for the individual services (i.e. “individual provisions”). In such situations, both the individual provisions and the Agreement will be in effect. If there is any conflict between the individual provisions and the Agreement, then the individual provisions will take precedence within their own scope.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>2.&nbsp;Registration Information and Privacy Protection</b></p>

<ol class="latin">
  <li>Smartisan reserves all rights over Smartisan accounts. The User must fill in the information on the registration page as specified, and after completing the registration and accepting the Agreement, they will obtain a Smartisan ID and be counted a Smartisan user. The User should provide timely, detailed, and accurate personal information, updating it continually. All originally input information will be cited as the registration information. If any problem should arise because of dishonest or out-of-date registration information, Smartisan will not hold any liability. The User should register with their genuine identification information, and their username, picture, and personal details should not include any illegal or illicit material. If, upon inspection by Smartisan, any part of the preceding is found to be the case, Smartisan will reject the registration. Moreover, after registration, if it is found that the User has used false information to register an account, or if the account picture and details present any illegal or illicit material, then Smartisan has the right to correct, suspend, or delete the account, among other measures, without the need to notify the User.</li>
  <li>The Smartisan ID includes both the account name and password. You may use the set account name (including the username, phone number, or email address) and password to log in to Smartisan. In the process of using the account, and to ensure the security of your account based on different end devices and usage habits, we may use various methods to verify your identity, e.g. if you are logging into your account for the first time with a new device, we may seek to verify your identity with a verification code. Verification methods include, but are not limited to, verification codes and service usage information verification.</li>
  <li>The User should not transfer, sell, or loan their account or password to any other party. If the User authorizes another to use their account, they accept liability for all activities of the authorized party on their account. Because accounts are affiliated with the User’s personal information, accounts may only be transferred where in accordance with the law, by court order, or by Smartisan’s approval, and where this meets with Smartisan’s regulations for account transfer.</li>
  <li>If the User should lose their account through some fault of their own and need to recover their Smartisan ID, they should provide corresponding information for the Smartisan ID they are requesting to recover and ensure that the information is valid and accurate. If the information provided does not satisfy and cannot be validated by Smartisan, Smartisan has the right to refuse the ID restoration request. If a sole credential of the account is invalid, Smartisan has the right to refuse to support the return of the account. For example, if a phone number has been resold, Smartisan may reject the restoration of the account linked to that number.</li>
  <li>Smartisan Privacy Protection: In order to provide services, enhance software performance and appearance, recommend new features, and so forth upon the basis of account creation, user identification, inquiry responses, correspondence, etc., Smartisan may collect and use relevant data generated in the course of your use of our products and services. In all cases, your information will be handled according to Smartisan’s Privacy Policy (http://www.smartisan.com/support/#/privacy).
